Feature: Finish by hand

***TO DO - This is still a skeleton and needs to be completed.
After I am found to be eligible, if I click the "Finish by hand" button,
I should be taken to the correct page.
If I click continue on that page, I should be taken to the final page.

Scenario: Just open the first page
    Given I start the interview "docassemble.playground42:juvenile-sealing-intro-9.yml#page11"

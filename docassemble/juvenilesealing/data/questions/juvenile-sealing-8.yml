  - Immigration asked in previous separate form.
  - Don't ask personal info until we know they want to print the form.
  - If they get here from the docket form, it's pro se user. Show more options.
  - Personal info code can look like https://github.com/GBLS/docassemble-gbls/blob/master/docassemble/gbls/data/questions/basic-questions-gbls.yml

  - Do objects always need to be in their own file? [No]
  - If I do `objects from file`, will that also pull
  in the logic below or do I have to import that separately?
  - Should `applicant` be `user` instead, even though the
  questions are about the applicant?

  We think you're probably eligible to seal your juvenile records.

  **You can also still see how to get a certified copy of the

  It can take a while, but
  it is a good idea to get them before finishing your form.

  ## What Next?

  We've created a form that has checkmarks in the
  right places.
  Now the form needs some of your
  personal information. You can do it two ways:
  
  1. Print the form and finish filling it out by hand.
  2. Keep using our online form to answer the
  questions.
  
  If you use our form, your personal information
  will be stored
  securely online and only you can ever see it.

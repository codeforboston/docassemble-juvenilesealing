question: Can You Seal Your Massachusetts Juvenile Records?
subquestion: |

  Sealing your juvenile record means that most
  employers won't be able to see that it
  exists. Only employers who do federal background checks and
  people like police will be able to see your criminal record.

  To see if you can try to seal your records, we will:

  1. Find out if there's a reason you **shouldn't** seal your records.
  1. Ask questions about your old and open cases.
  1. Tell you if we think you can seal your records.

  Then you can get your form right away or let us help
  you fill in the other parts too.

  ### Time

  It can take up to **40 minutes** to answer all the questions,
  though it's usually less.

  ### What you need

  You need to know about your closed cases and open cases.
  That includes cases in other states and federal cases.
  Having {a copy of your criminal records}
  can help you know the answers to the questions.

  ### Privacy

  If we need to store anything about your identity
  we will ask you first.

  <br/>

  **Note:** Whenever we say USA
  that includes United States
  possessions (like Guam).

question: Why Get Docket Sheets?
subquestion: |
  There are times when it is important to have certified copies of
  your docket sheets for all your cases.

  If you seal your records you won't be able to get
  certified copies of your docket sheets until you
  unseal them again. Unsealing your records can
  take a long time.

  If you're not a US citizen, it can be very important to have
  the copies for a hearing, like an immigration hearing. It is
  a good idea  to a lawyer before you seal
  your records.

  Certified copies of your docket sheets can also help for:

  * Getting jobs that need a federal background check
  * Applying for some government programs
  * Taking legal action related to your arrest or the case (like suing someone)
  * Whenever you need to prove what happened in the case

  Once you seal your records, you'll have to unseal them to get
  certified copies. That can sometimes take a while.

  ### What are docket sheets?

  ${docket_sheets_blurb} Docket
  sheets are papers from the courthouse that say
  what happened in a case every time you went
  to court for that case.

  ### What's a certified copy of docket sheets?

  A certified copy of docket sheets
  will have a special mark on it that looks like the
  courthouse's seal. It'll either be a colored stamp or
  an area where the paper is raised up in the shape of the
  seal.

  Do you want to get certified copies of your docket sheets before
  filling out the form to seal your records?

  It will help to know about your criminal records in Massachusetts
  and in other states. You won't get in trouble for getting
  answers wrong, but it might be easier for you to give the
  right answers if you have a copy of both your juvenile record,
  and also your CORI report if you had cases in an adult court.
  These reports will give a summary of all your criminal charges
  in Massachusetts and tell you how each case ended.

  To ask for your online
  adult CORI report, make an account at
  [Massachusetts iCORI site ${external_link_icon}](https://icori.chs.state.ma.us/icori/ext/global/landing.action?page=1&bod=1566991096995&m=presentLanding).
  It costs $25, but if you are low income you might be be able
  to ask for a waiver of the fee so you don't have to pay it.

  Once you mail it,
  the Commissioner of Probation
  will look at the petition you sent and at your criminal
  records. They'll see if they agree that you can seal
  your juvenile records.

  ## How will I know if my juvenile records are sealed?

  The Commissioner of Probation will send you a letter to
  tell you what they decide. The letter will say which records
  have been sealed. If some records aren't sealed, the letter
  will tell you why they made that decision. It can take up to
  3 months to get a letter because so many people send them
  petitions to seal records.

  If the letter says your records are sealed, it can still
  take about two weeks till your records are ready. Usually
  it's faster. After that, most employers won't see
  you have any record at all. Only employers who do federal
  background checks and people like police will be able to see
  your criminal record.

  If you get the letter back and don't agree with what they
  said, you can call the Commissionerâ€™s Office and ask
  them to explain to you why they would not seal all your
  records. The number is (617) 727 - 5300. You can also

  Remember that not every area has someone that
  can help with criminal records.

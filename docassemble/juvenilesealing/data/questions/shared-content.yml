question: Why Get Docket Sheets?
subquestion: |
  There are times when it is important to have certified copies of
  your docket sheets for all your cases.

  If you seal your records you won't be able to get
  certified copies of your docket sheets until you
  unseal them again. Unsealing your records can
  take a long time.

  If you're not a US citizen, it can be very important to have
  the copies for a hearing, like an immigration hearing. It is
  a good idea  to a lawyer before you seal
  your records.

  Certified copies of your docket sheets can also help for:

  * Getting jobs that need a federal background check
  * Applying for some government programs
  * Taking legal action related to your arrest or the case (like suing someone)
  * Whenever you need to prove what happened in the case

  Once you seal your records, you'll have to unseal them to get
  certified copies. That can sometimes take a while.

  ### What are docket sheets?

  ${docket_sheets_blurb} Docket
  sheets are papers from the courthouse that say
  what happened in a case every time you went
  to court for that case.

  ### What's special about a certified copy of a docket sheet?

  A certified copy of docket sheets
  will have a special mark on it that looks like the
  courthouse's seal. It'll either be a colored stamp or
  an area where the paper is raised up in the shape of the
  seal.

  Do you want to find out how to get certified copies
  of your docket sheets?

question: How to Get Certified Docket Sheets
subquestion: |
  Having
  {a copy of your Massachusetts criminal records}
  can make it easier to make sure you get all your docket
  sheets because they will have the docket numbers for
  your cases. Every case has its own docket
  sheets and those sheets are kept at the courthouse
  that handled that case.

  Docket sheets for a case are kept at the courthouse
  that handled that case. To get docket sheets for a
  case, you might need to know the docket number of
  that case. You can find those docket numbers on
  {your Massachusetts CORI report and on your juvenile records}.

  ### Getting certified copies in person

  Getting copies in person is the easiest and fastest
  way to do this. For each case, go to the clerk’s
  office in the courthouse that handled the case and say,
  "I'd like certified copies of my docket sheets
  for all of my cases." You have to do it
  at each courthouse where you had a case. You might need
  to know the docket numbers of your cases.

  It can cost up to $2.50 for each page
  that they have to print, but if you
  can't afford to pay that much, you can say, "I'd like
  to fill out an affidavit of indigency to waive the fee."
  The staff should then give you a form to fill out.
  You will write down how much you get paid on that form
  to show why you can’t afford to pay the fee.

  ### Getting certified copies by mail

  Even though it's easier and faster to go in person,
  you can also send a letter to ask for the docket
  sheets. It can take two weeks or so. You will need
  to know the docket number of your cases. If you want
  to order the sheets by mail, take
  these steps:

  1. Call the courthouse that handled the case
  and ask how much you need to pay the court to
  print and mail the sheets.
  1. Go to a post office to get a money order for that amount.
  1. Write a letter that asks for the docket
  sheets. An example of what it can look like is at
  the bottom of this page.
  1. Print that letter and sign it.
  1. Put the letter and the money order in an envelope.
  1. On the front of the envelope, write the courthouse’s name and address.
  1. Above that address, write *Attention: Criminal clerk's office*. See an example of that below.
  1. Write your own mailing address in the top left of the envelope.
  1. Put a stamp on the envelope and mail it.

  If you don't get anything back after two or three weeks,
  call the clerk's office. Tell them, "I mailed a request
  for my docket sheets. Can you help me find out when I'll
  get those?"

question: How to Get Certified Docket Sheets
subquestion: |
  Having
  {a copy of your Massachusetts criminal records}
  can make it easier to make sure you get all your docket
  sheets because they will have the docket numbers for
  your cases. Every case has its own docket
  sheets and those sheets are kept at the courthouse
  that handled that case.

  Docket sheets for a case are kept at the courthouse
  that handled that case. To get docket sheets for a
  case, you might need to know the docket number of
  that case. You can find those docket numbers on
  {your Massachusetts CORI report and on your juvenile records}.

  ### Getting certified copies in person

  Getting copies in person is the easiest and fastest
  way to do this. For each case, go to the clerk’s
  office in the courthouse that handled the case and say,
  "I'd like certified copies of my docket sheets
  for all of my cases." You have to do it
  at each courthouse where you had a case. You might need
  to know the docket numbers of your cases.

  It can cost up to $2.50 for each page
  that they have to print, but if you
  can't afford to pay that much, you can say, "I'd like
  to fill out an affidavit of indigency to waive the fee."
  The staff should then give you a form to fill out.
  You will write down how much you get paid on that form
  to show why you can’t afford to pay the fee.

  ### Getting certified copies by mail

  Even though it's easier and faster to go in person,
  you can also send a letter to ask for the docket
  sheets. It can take two weeks or so. You will need
  to know the docket number of your cases. If you want
  to order the sheets by mail, take
  these steps:

  1. Call the courthouse that handled the case
  and ask how much you need to pay the court to
  print and mail the sheets.
  1. Go to a post office to get a money order for that amount.
  1. Write a letter that asks for the docket
  sheets. An example of what it can look like is at
  the bottom of this page.
  1. Print that letter and sign it.
  1. Put the letter and the money order in an envelope.
  1. On the front of the envelope, write the courthouse’s name and address.
  1. Above that address, write *Attention: Criminal clerk's office*. See an example of that below.
  1. Write your own mailing address in the top left of the envelope.
  1. Put a stamp on the envelope and mail it.

  If you don't get anything back after two or three weeks,
  call the clerk's office. Tell them, "I mailed a request
  for my docket sheets. Can you help me find out when I'll
  get those?"

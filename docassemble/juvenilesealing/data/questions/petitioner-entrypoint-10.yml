question: Can You Seal Your Massachusetts Juvenile Records?
subquestion: |
  Sealing your juvenile record means that most
  employers won't be able to see that it
  exists. Only employers who do federal background checks and
  people like police will be able to see your criminal record.

  To see if you can try to seal your records, we will:

  1. Find out if there's a reason you **shouldn't** seal your records.
  1. Ask questions about your old and open cases.
  1. Tell you if we think you can seal your records.

  Then you can get your form right away or let us help
  you fill in the other parts too.

  ### Time

  It can take up to **40 minutes** to answer all the questions,
  though it's usually less.

  ### What you need

  You need to know about your closed cases and open cases.
  That includes cases in other states and federal cases.
  Having {a copy of your criminal records}
  can help you know the answers to the questions.

  ### Privacy

  If we need to store anything about your identity
  we will ask you first.

  <br/>

  **Note:** Whenever we say USA
  that includes United States
  possessions (like Guam).

  for all of your juvenile cases?

  **Note:** A docket sheet is different than a criminal
  record report (called a CORI) or juvenile record report.

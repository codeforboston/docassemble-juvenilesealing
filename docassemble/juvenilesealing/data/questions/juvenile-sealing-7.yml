  - Immigration asked in previous separate form.
  - If sent from that form, it's a pro se user, so provide more info
  - Personal info code copies style of https://github.com/GBLS/docassemble-gbls/blob/master/docassemble/gbls/data/questions/basic-questions-gbls.yml

  - Do objects always need to be in the file in which they are used?
    [No]
  - If I do `objects from file`, will that also pull
  in the logic below or do I have to import that separately?
  - Should `applicant` be `user` instead, even though the
  questions are about the applicant?

  - applicant: Individual

  TODO: make page about getting docket sheets
question: You Might Be Eligible!
subquestion: |
  We think you're probably eligible to seal your juvenile records.

  % if (needs_dockets):
  **You can also still see how to get a certified copy of the
  docket sheets for all of your cases**.
  It can take a while, but
  it is a good idea to get them before finishing your form.
  % endif
  
  We've created a form that has checkmarks in the
  right places.
  Now the form needs some of your
  personal information. You can do it two ways:
  
  1. Print the form and finish filling it out by hand.
  2. Keep using our online form to answer the
  questions.
  
  If you use our form, your personal information
  will be stored
  securely online and only you can ever see it.

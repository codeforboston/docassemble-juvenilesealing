# Finished Sealing TODOs
  
## Done
- Custom attachment page with custom email contents!
- Add language/questions/clarity specifying MA
- Call a section explicitly 'How will I know my record
is sealed?'
- Add 'You won't get in trouble for getting an answer
wrong.'
- Don't use the term 'CARI' for juvenile records. It's a
little different and would be confusing.

---------------------

# V5.3 Group feedback
- 'Place of Birth' to 'Place of birth' to match others
- 'If you want, we'll ask you for things like your name and
social security number to help us fill out the rest of the form
for you. (did something similar)
- Fix 40 min text typos. 'up to 40 minutes'

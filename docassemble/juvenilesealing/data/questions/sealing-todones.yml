# Finished Sealing TODOs
  
## Done
- Add language/questions/clarity specifying MA
- Call a section explicitly 'How will I know my record
is sealed?'
- Add 'You won't get in trouble for getting an answer
wrong.'
- Don't use the term 'CARI' for juvenile records. It's a
little different and would be confusing.

  # Answered Questions D:
  Q: is this trying to give directions to go
  to the courthouse? If so, maybe we can handle
  this by creating a link to an informational page
  I make. The more text we add, the less people are
  going to read.
    "You also might have to stop and come back later
    if you need to get a certified copy **of “docket sheets”
    from your case at the courthouse.**"
  A: will look (for what?)
  status: text has been written, inner page linked to.
  todo: Ask Quinten about adding a webpage on gbls for that.

  xQ: I added resource for regular sealing info too
  [-done-] A: ok

  xQ: They can explain without the docket sheets. They need the sheets to prove what happened.
    "it may be more easy to explain what happened in your case"
  [-done-] A:  they might want to look at the sheets to see if they can hire you.

  xQ: Where did you want "SEALING YOUR JUVENILE RECORDS" to go in here?

    "...finishing your form.

    SEALING YOUR JUVENILE RECORDS

    We've created..."
  [-done-] A: What do you want to do next or something as heading in between content

  xQ: Father's name

  # Answered Questions B
  1. How get records of other states
    todo: "A MA CORI or juvenile record report won't have
      information about cases from other states."
    [-done-] todo: back off of getting records
  1b. Can't help them get those records?
  answer: clean slate clearing house. For info for getting records
    from other states.
    todo: Will be sent link for clean slate clearing house.
  x 2. Work for the military, too (contractors)?
  [-done-]: "Join or work for the military."
  [-done-]: "Certain jobs at a bank." (teller is sometimes
    ok) (mortgage broker a problem)
  x 3. All children?
  answer: Not high school students. Under 6 or so.
  [-done-]: "young children"
  4. Separate page for docket instructions?
  answer: Maybe
    Info: best to request in person. Mail sometimes falls between the cracks.
    Often people don't get dockets on their own. Maybe not so
    important with sealing. Expungement is different.
  x 5. Some things on CORI don't say 'convicted'. More detailed instructions?
    answer: cori makes it easy. each says if it's a
      conviction. juvi records hard to read.
      5a1. Picture of what to look for?
      5a2. Picture of where to look?
      [-done-] answer: Back off a bit about records. Most people know
        answers well enough and they'll get feedback if
        they're missing info.
          [-done-]: Don't block.
  6. Post-release handling.
  answer/todo: We're all happy to keep iterating.
  7. Add link to expungement info?
  answer/todo: maybe. only if we find a good place
  Notes:
  - Don't use the term 'CARI'. It's a little different and would be confusing.

    work really well. They'll send it over just for us to get a gander.
  2. What if there is no legal help in their area?
  answer: That's a tough question. There are lots of little
    things to persue.

    you have a case and talk to somebody in probation, for example.
    - Also, if send petition in and rejected, will get reasons why.

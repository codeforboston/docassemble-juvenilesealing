# Sealing process clarity
* 10. How long after getting the letter from probation will
all the departments fully put sealing into effect?
todo:
  - Mail-in process: Two weeks or so.
    - Comissioner sends to courthouse.
    - courthouse pulls files, put them in a segregated area.
    - Off of decegis right away, out of the courts is later.
  - Non-mail process:
    - Probation signs off, send to commissioner of probation (1 week)
    - That can appeal
  - 'By the time you get into an interview, this should no longer
  be on your record'
* 11. How long does it take to get your docket sheets by mail?
todo: Add text about this:
  - In person right away unless really old (80's or 90's)
    - Ask how long it is going to take.
  - By mail can take up to a couple weeks.
* 7. Need to warn about social equity program for marijuana
businesses before sealing? What other such programs, etc.
are there?
todo: Shorten interface 'applying for jobs or programs,
bring charges against the court'

* 8. Add info about court self-help centers (what's the info?)
todo: (call up the court. maybe list online. website for trial courts may have numbers. google it)
* 9. Is there anything specific we can put about what a successful
letter from probation would look like?
todo: Will list all the records that are sealed. Should be clear.
Will look for
sample acceptance and rejection letters. Most part the system is
good about sealing the recors that need it.

3. Where to put text about some people not getting help?
todo: talk about text to group

---------------------

* # Sealing process Questions
* 3. How do the _courts_ get records from other states?
todo: Nothing.
  - Tripple i. They can have probation run the record. Hard
  for an individual to do it.
* 5. Can a dismissal can still be on your record sometimes?
How to ask them about that? Does it still count as
convicted if there was misconduct, etc? If they're going
off of their record.
todo: Yes, non convictions can be on your record. It can be on
your CORI. Any time your case isn't dismissed before arraignment.
Did you ever have a trial. (diff experience between trial
and arraignment?)
* 2. Is there anything that's expungable/sealable that's not on your
CORI or CARI?
todo: Won't address weeds
  - Criminal case dismissed before arraignment. There will be
  a physical file at the courthouse. People can get that file.
  Won't show up on CORI, though. Will be sealed.
* 6. Need copies of disposition as well as dockets? Heard this.
todo: Nothing. It's on the docket sheets

---------------------

# Immigration
1b. todo: As project liason about immigration stuff.
1. Immigration feedback?
todo: Add question/page about legal consult [in what
way did I mean this?]

---------------------

# Answered Questions D:
Q: is this trying to give directions to go to the
courthouse? If so, maybe we can handle
this by creating a link to an informational page
I make. The more text we add, the less people are
going to read.
  "You also might have to stop and come back later
  if you need to get a certified copy **of “docket sheets”
  from your case at the courthouse.**"
A: will look (for what? I think a page created for dockets)
status: text has been written, have linked to inner page.
todo: Get an eye on it.

# Answered Questions B
1b. Can't help them get out of state records?
answer: clean slate clearing house. For info for getting records
  from other states.
  todo: Will be sent link for clean slate clearing house.

# A Questions
1b. They have a form for something else that seems to
  work really well. They'll send it over just for us to get a
  gander.
  todo: ask about the form
2. What if there is no legal help in their area?
  answer: Tough question. There are lots of little
  things to persue.
  - Go to courthouse of any court where
  you have a case and talk to somebody in probation, for example.
  - Also, if send petition in and rejected, will get reasons why.
  - Honestly address people who may not be able to get help.
  todo: That stuff
3. Link to info on CORI FAQ - what if CORI wrong, what it is etc.?
  answer: mass legal help website about that
  todo: (done?) (what if cori wrong) will send link. Also, though, de-emphasize
  getting records
5. further resources:
answer: Will send
  - applying for jobs booklet (will be put online)
  - [-done-] cori and housing
  - employment
  - [-done/not doing-] ~Big know your cori rights booklet~
  - [-done-] GBLS booklets links page

# Expungement
1. Time-based expungement is pretty straightforward? In
DA opinion?
2. Language about, 'This is to help you learn if you might
be eligible and to apply/try to expunge, not if you're
eligible to expunge.'
3. For expungement, do convictions in other states matter
too?
4. TODO: Describe difference between misdemeanor and felony?
5. Need to send a sealing/expungement petition to each
court where you had a case or just one place?
5. Is there such a thing as expungement for a not <21
first-time misdemeanor? I heard somewhere that there was.
Wasn't sure of the source I was getting it from.
todo:

  # Answered Questions D:
  Q: is this trying to give directions to go
  to the courthouse? If so, maybe we can handle
  this by creating a link to an informational page
  I make. The more text we add, the less people are
  going to read.

    if you need to get a certified copy **of “docket sheets”
    from your case at the courthouse.**"

  DA opinion?
  2. Language about, 'This is to help you learn if you might

  too?

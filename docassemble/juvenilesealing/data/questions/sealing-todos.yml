# TODOs

- How do you waive the fee for a CORI online? I saw it once,
but don't remember
- Validate and control birthday entry? That tends to have more
variety considering some people include 0's and some don't
- TODO: More consistency with page titles being questions vs.
being topics. Questions should be in small text right above the
button choices.
- TODO: Validate and control zipcode entry
- TODO: What do we want to do about letting people 'sign in' to
save their progress? Is that only important if/when we add a todo
list tracker?
- TODO: Check what text editing work has been undone in the past
by combing through old commits (prior to... Oct. 3rd or something?)
- TODO: Now or future? Explain when to seal and when to expunge.
Scale of 1 to 10, how much impact will it have. It's complicated
and might be beyond the MVP. That might actually be its own form.
- TODO: How best to let people know on the first form that
going to the sealing form will take them away from this
form and these answers will be lost? - Considering combining the
forms and maybe not directly ask about citizenship since we're
being more lenient about that.
- TODO: How to warn people about navigating away from any of the
forms - 'your data will be lost'. Is it already done automatically?
[I think this may be the same as the question above]
- TODO: Group links into categories with headings [Is the current
version sufficient?]
- TODO: More clarity on first (or maybe on first question?) page
about not doing out of state sealing.
- TODO: Change `out_of_state_records` to something more like:
"Other states' court websites may have information on how you
can request your records from them."
- TODO: Link on first page to just more resources page? Note: We
have a text template of resources that we can re-use to just
have a resources page that's not the final page. We might want
to create a 'resources' block in that shared text file that
can be linked to in both interview files.
- TODO: Compare getting certified copies text from spreadsheet
to certified-copy-of-dockets-8.yml
- TODO: Where to request feedback about bugs, etc?
- TODO: GBLS informational pages? Plan for maintanance?
- TODO: [I've forgotten what this means. Navigating to previous
questionnaire?] Equivalent of 
  url: |
    ${ referring_url() }
but don't send back to preliminary questions. [to accomplish what?]
[Maybe this was about not being able to go back to
docket sheet questionnaire from the sealing questionnaire...]

---------------------

# V5.3 Group feedback
- todo: Don't take users away from the page for definitions of
words. Maybe try terms: https://docassemble.org/docs/initial.html#terms
- todo: 'To find out if you can try to seal your record,
these are the steps we'll do with you:'. Maybe.
  done? Attempt made needs to be checked.
- todo: Replace the word 'eligible' wherever possible?
- todo: Discuss how/where to use the word 'petition' vs. 'form'
- todo: 'You need to know' to 'It will help if you know'
Maybe then we don't need the warning about getting answers wrong?
Either way, do more to de-emphasize.
- todo: It's ok if you get some answers wrong.
- todo: 'a copy of -both- your juvenile record ~report~, and also...'
- todo: remove green from text
- todo: Something like: "Other states' court websites may have
information on how you can request your records from them." instead
of 'do your best'.

# Misc

# Users
* Q: If we can attend some of the CORI clinics, what kinds of
things would it be ok for us to do there?
todo: 

---------------------

# Form questions
3. Just skip non-required personal question fields?
todo: Sure, we'll see which ones.

Q: "You also might have to stop and come back later
  if you need to get a certified copy **of “docket sheets”
  from your case at the courthouse.**"
Is this trying to give directions to go to the
courthouse? If so, maybe we can handle
this by creating a link to an informational page
we make. The more text we add, the less people are
going to read.
A: will look (I think a page created for dockets)
status: text has been written, have linked to inner page.
todo: Get an eye on it.

* What age is juvenile?
todo: 

* What with the GBLS page linking to this form look like? Can
it talk about the difference between sealing and expungement?

1. QQ: Who gets the feedback? Link back to CFJJ advocacy work somehow?
todo: answer: 

---------------------

# Sealing process clarity for users
* How do you get your federal records? Are they on your CORI?
todo: 
11. How long does it take to get your docket sheets by mail?
todo: Add text about this:
  - In person right away unless really old (80's or 90's)
    - Ask how long it is going to take.
  - By mail can take up to a couple weeks.
7. Need to warn about social equity program for marijuana
businesses before sealing? What other such programs, etc.
are there?
todo: Shorten interface 'applying for jobs or programs,
bring charges against the court'
9. Is there anything specific we can put about what a successful
letter from probation would look like?
todo: Will list all the records that are sealed. Should be clear.
Will be given
sample acceptance and rejection letters. Most part the system is
good about sealing the recors that need it.

* How long does it take to unseal records?
todo: 

---------------------

# Sealing process Questions from us
5. Can a dismissal still be on your record sometimes?
How to ask them about that? Does it still count as
convicted if there was misconduct, etc? If they're going
off of their record.
todo: Yes, non-convictions can be on your record. It can be on
your CORI. Any time your case isn't dismissed before arraignment.
Did you ever have a trial. (diff experience between trial
and arraignment?)
2. Is there anything that's expungable/sealable that's not on your
CORI or CARI?
todo: Won't address weeds
  - Criminal case dismissed before arraignment. There will be
  a physical file at the courthouse. People can get that file.
  Won't show up on CORI, though. Will be sealed. But will be
  physically available until sealed or expunged (I think).

1. Immigration feedback?

way did I mean this?]

list of what you can read in Know Your CORI Rights)
todo: Same link as applying for a job. They will put up
separate doc.

+ 2. What if there is no legal help for this in their area?
  answer: Tough question. There are lots of little
  things to persue.
  - Go to courthouse of any court where
  you have a case and talk to somebody in probation, for example.
  - Also, if send petition in and rejected, will get reasons why.
  - Honestly address people who may not be able to get help.
  todo: That stuff. Talk to team:

  model for that advice.

---------------------

# Expungement
1. Time-based expungement is pretty straightforward? In
DA opinion?
2. Language about, 'This is to help you learn if you might
be eligible and to apply/try to expunge, not if you're
eligible to expunge.'
3. For expungement, do convictions in other states matter
too?
4. TODO: Describe difference between misdemeanor and felony?
5. Need to send a sealing/expungement petition to each
court where you had a case or just one place?
5. Is there such a thing as expungement for a not <21
first-time misdemeanor? I heard somewhere that there was.
Wasn't sure of the source I was getting it from.

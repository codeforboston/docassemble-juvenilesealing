# TODOs

---------------------
# Team

- Other printing questions:
  - How do we help people figure out how to find the files
  on their phone after downloading it?
  - Is it possible to help them print it straight from the
  browser instead?
- Help with language for linking to finding legal help
on dockets page.
todo: 
- What if there is no legal help for this in their area?
  answer: Tough question. There are lots of little
  things to persue. Write text: |
    - Go to courthouse of any court where you have a case and
    talk to somebody in probation, for example.
    (https://www.mass.gov/guides/find-a-courthouse-serving-you)
    - Also, if send petition in and rejected, will get reasons why.
    - Honestly address people who may not be able to get help.
  - Possibility (with slight language adustment): |
    Unfortunately, the below list of resources
    may not include any resources that you can use. We are
    working on improving this tool, and if you have any
    feedback or suggestions for us on what we could do
    better, please email us at XXX@gbls.org.
- Should birthdate numbers be controlled or validated?
(no 00 till end, no above 12 in months). People may just be in
the middle of putting in their birthdate.
- How do you waive the fee for a CORI online? I saw it once,
but don't remember
- TODO: What do we want to do about letting people 'sign in' to
save their progress? Is that only important if/when we add a todo
list tracker?
- TODO: Check what text editing work has been undone in the past
by combing through old commits (prior to... Oct. 3rd or something?)
- TODO: (Now or future?) Explain when to seal and when to expunge.
Scale of 1 to 10, how much impact will it have. It's complicated
and might be beyond the MVP. That might actually be its own form.
- ++ TODO: How best to let people know on the first form that
going to the sealing form will take them away from this
form and these answers will be lost? - [Considering combining the
forms and maybe not directly ask about citizenship since we're
being more lenient about that. v9 is a draft of that.]
- TODO: Group links into categories with headings [Is the current
version sufficient?]
- TODO: More clarity on first (or maybe on first question?) page
about not doing out of state sealing.
- ++ TODO: Change `out_of_state_records` to something more like:
"Other states' court websites may have information on how you
can request your records from them." instead of 'do your best'.
[Done in v9 draft, but not implemented officially yet (like some
other stuff.)]
- TODO: Link on first page to just more resources page? Note: We
have a text template of resources that we can re-use to just
have a resources page that's not the final page. We might want
to create a 'resources' block in that shared text file that
can be linked to in both interview files.
- TODO: Compare getting certified copies text from spreadsheet
to certified-copy-of-dockets-8.yml
- TODO: Where to request feedback about bugs, etc?
- TODO: GBLS informational pages? Plan for maintanance?
- TODO: [I've forgotten what this means. Navigating to previous
questionnaire?] Equivalent of 
  url: |
    ${ referring_url() }
but don't send back to preliminary questions. [to accomplish what?]
[Maybe this was about not being able to go back to
docket sheet questionnaire from the sealing questionnaire...]

---------------------

# V5.3 Group feedback
- ++ todo: Don't take users away from the page for definitions of
words. Maybe try terms: https://docassemble.org/docs/initial.html#terms
  status: terms implemented, waiting for feedback. [See v9]
- todo: 'To find out if you can try to seal your record,
these are the steps we'll do with you:'. Maybe.
  status: implemented, waiting for feedback.
- todo: Replace the word 'eligible' wherever possible?
- todo: Discuss how/where to use the word 'petition' vs. 'form'
- todo: It's ok if you get some answers wrong.

---------------------

# Misc
* P: Replace the word 'eligible' wherever possible?
todo:

* P: Discuss how/where to use the word 'petition' vs. 'form'
todo:

----------------------

# Users
* Q: If we can attend some of the CORI clinics, what kinds of
things would it be ok for us to do there?
todo: 

---------------------

# Form questions
* What if a person doesn't know if they're a citizen?

todo:

it talk about the difference between sealing and expungement?
todo:

** 1. QQ: Who gets the feedback? Link back to CFJJ
advocacy work somehow?
todo: answer: 

** 3. Just skip non-required personal question fields?
todo: Sure, we'll see which ones.

Q: "You also might have to stop and come back later
  if you need to get a certified copy **of “docket sheets”
  from your case at the courthouse.**"
Is this trying to give directions to go to the
courthouse? If so, maybe we can handle
this by creating a link to an informational page
we make. The more text we add, the less people are
going to read.
A: will look (I think a page created for dockets)
status: text has been written, have linked to inner page.
todo: Get an eye on it.

---------------------

# Sealing process clarity for users

* Needs to be gotten from individual relevant courthouses?
  1. docket sheets: yes
  2. CORI report(s): no
  3. Juvenile record(s):
  4. Help from court services for (legal help/just support??):

* How long does it take to unseal records?
todo: 

* How do you get your federal records? Are they on your CORI?

businesses before sealing? What other such programs, etc.
are there?
todo: Shorten interface 'applying for jobs or programs,
bring charges against the court' [see v9]

9. Is there anything specific we can put about what a successful
letter from probation would look like?
todo: Will list all the records that are sealed. Should be clear.
Will be given
** sample acceptance and rejection letters. Most part the system is
good about sealing the recors that need it.

---------------------

# Sealing process Questions from us

* Q: Did you ever have a trial? <- useful question?
(diff experience between trial and arraignment?)

---------------------

# Immigration

** 4. About applying for jobs - where is that link in the kyr booklet?
Did not find.
todo: The _info_ is in the booklet. There's a separate doc they'll
put online, though. (followup)

Stretch goal that covers a lot of the below?: |
  a list of the questions most people ask about
  their criminal records, pick the top few, and think about
  the best link or links for information about them.
  Some ideas:
  - How do I get my criminal records? (we're already answering this one)
  - What if I think my CORI is wrong?
  - Who can see my records?
  - Who can see my records after I seal them?
  - Who can see my records after I expunge them?
  - Can I seal my juvenile records?
  - Can I seal my adult records?
  - Can I expunge my records?

** 5. 'What will employers see' link at the beginning? (maybe
list of what you can read in Know Your CORI Rights)
todo: Same link as applying for a job. They will put up
separate doc (doc mentioned above as job doc).

+ 2. [listed in team section] What if there is no legal help
  for this in their area?
  answer: Tough question. There are lots of little
  things to persue.
  - Go to courthouse of any court where you have a case and
  talk to somebody in probation, for example.
  (https://www.mass.gov/guides/find-a-courthouse-serving-you)
  - Also, if send petition in and rejected, will get reasons why.
  - Honestly address people who may not be able to get help.
  todo: That stuff. Talk to team:
  - Possibility (with slight language adustment): |
    Unfortunately, the below list of resources
    may not include any resources that you can use. We are
    working on improving this tool, and if you have any
    feedback or suggestions for us on what we could do
    better, please email us at XXX@gbls.org.

** 4. [Are we going to include this? Is it a question people
specifically have on their minds?]
Which is the 'what if your CORI seems wrong'
booklet? Do we already have the link to that?
todo: kyr booklet. Section on mass legal help website -
correcting record.
todo: What is the section/link?
[Duplicate of above]
3. Link to info on CORI FAQ - what if CORI wrong, what it is etc.?
  answer: mass legal help website about that
  todo: (has the following been done?) (what if cori wrong) will
  send link. Also, though, de-emphasize getting records

++ 8. [Done, but needs review] Add info about court self-help centers. What's the info?
todo: call up the court. maybe list online. website for trial
courts may have numbers. google it. (do I remember this right?:
Each one has different ways in which they might be willing
to help? Some may help print stuff?) Put up some text and get
review.

5. further resources Will send:
  - applying for jobs booklet (will be put online)
  - [-done-] cori and housing
  - employment (same as jobs booklet?)
  - [-done/not doing?-] Big know your cori rights booklet -
  ask group (followup)
  - [-done-] GBLS booklets links page

Court services center to print it out. Call ahead before you go.
  todo: Ask on slack about housing form. Might have a good
  model for that advice. for: calling to ask for help when
  they don't have other support, call to ask for dockets maybe,
  anything else?

---------------------

# Transfer to important project knowledge

5. Can a dismissal still be on your record sometimes?
How to ask them about that? Does it still count as
convicted if there was misconduct, etc? If they're going
off of their record.
todo: Yes, non-convictions can be on your record. It can be on
your CORI. Any time your case isn't dismissed before arraignment.

2. Is there anything that's expungable/sealable that's not on your
CORI or CARI?
todo: Won't address weeds
  - Criminal case dismissed before arraignment. There will be
  a physical file at the courthouse. People can get that file.
  Won't show up on CORI, though. Will be sealed. But will be
  physically available until sealed or expunged (I think).

---------------------

# Expungement
1. Time-based expungement is pretty straightforward? In
DA opinion?
2. Language about, 'This is to help you learn if you might
be eligible and to apply/try to expunge, not if you're
eligible to expunge.'
3. For expungement, do convictions in other states matter
too?
4. TODO: Describe difference between misdemeanor and felony?
5. Need to send a sealing/expungement petition to each
court where you had a case or just one place?
* 5. Is there such a thing as expungement for a not <21
first-time misdemeanor? I heard somewhere that there was.
Wasn't sure of the source I was getting it from.
todo: 

# Not TODOs

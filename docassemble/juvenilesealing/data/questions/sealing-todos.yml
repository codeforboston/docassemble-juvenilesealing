# TODOs

- TODO: [I've forgotten what this means. Navigating to previous
questionnaire?] Equivalent of 
  url: |
    ${ referring_url() }
but don't send back to preliminary questions. [to accomplish what?]
[Maybe this was about not being able to go back to
docket sheet questionnaire from the sealing questionnaire...]

---------------------

# V5.3 Group feedback
- todo: 'Place of Birth' to 'Place of birth' to match others

todo: 

---------------------

# Form questions
* 3. Just skip non-required personal question fields?
todo: Sure, we'll see which ones.

* Q: "You also might have to stop and come back later
  if you need to get a certified copy **of “docket sheets”
  from your case at the courthouse.**"
Is this trying to give directions to go to the
courthouse? If so, maybe we can handle
this by creating a link to an informational page
we make. The more text we add, the less people are
going to read.
A: will look (I think a page created for dockets)
status: text has been written, have linked to inner page.
todo: Get an eye on it.

1. QQ: Who gets the feedback? Link back to CFJJ advocacy work somehow?
todo: answer:

# Sealing process clarity for users
* 10. How long after getting the letter from probation will
all the departments fully put sealing into effect?
todo:
  - Mail-in process: Two weeks or so.
    - Comissioner sends to courthouse.
    - courthouse pulls files, put them in a segregated area.
    - Off of decegis right away, out of the courts is later.
  - Non-mail process:
    - Probation signs off, send to commissioner of probation (1 week)
    - That can appeal
  - 'By the time you get into an interview, this should no longer
  be on your record'
* 11. How long does it take to get your docket sheets by mail?
todo: Add text about this:
  - In person right away unless really old (80's or 90's)
    - Ask how long it is going to take.
  - By mail can take up to a couple weeks.
* 7. Need to warn about social equity program for marijuana
businesses before sealing? What other such programs, etc.
are there?
todo: Shorten interface 'applying for jobs or programs,
bring charges against the court'
* 9. Is there anything specific we can put about what a successful
letter from probation would look like?
todo: Will list all the records that are sealed. Should be clear.
Will be given
sample acceptance and rejection letters. Most part the system is
good about sealing the recors that need it.

---------------------

* # Sealing process Questions from us
* 5. Can a dismissal still be on your record sometimes?
How to ask them about that? Does it still count as
convicted if there was misconduct, etc? If they're going
off of their record.
todo: Yes, non-convictions can be on your record. It can be on
your CORI. Any time your case isn't dismissed before arraignment.
Did you ever have a trial. (diff experience between trial
and arraignment?)
* 2. Is there anything that's expungable/sealable that's not on your
CORI or CARI?
todo: Won't address weeds
  - Criminal case dismissed before arraignment. There will be
  a physical file at the courthouse. People can get that file.
  Won't show up on CORI, though. Will be sealed. But will be
  physically available until sealed or expunged (I think).

separate doc.

3. Where to put text about some people not getting help?
todo: talk about text to group (followup)
2. What if there is no legal help in their area?
  answer: Tough question. There are lots of little
  things to persue.

  - Honestly address people who may not be able to get help.
  todo: That stuff. Talk to group

booklet? Do we already have the link to that?

todo: call up the court. maybe list online. website for trial
courts may have numbers. google it. (do I remember this right?:
Each one has different ways in which they might be willing
to help? Some may help print stuff?) Put up some text and get
review.

3. Link to info on CORI FAQ - what if CORI wrong, what it is etc.?
  answer: mass legal help website about that

  todo: Ask on slack about housing form. Might have a good
  model for that advice.

---------------------

# Expungement
1. Time-based expungement is pretty straightforward? In
DA opinion?
2. Language about, 'This is to help you learn if you might
be eligible and to apply/try to expunge, not if you're
eligible to expunge.'
3. For expungement, do convictions in other states matter
too?
4. TODO: Describe difference between misdemeanor and felony?
5. Need to send a sealing/expungement petition to each
court where you had a case or just one place?
5. Is there such a thing as expungement for a not <21
first-time misdemeanor? I heard somewhere that there was.
Wasn't sure of the source I was getting it from.

  To find out, this is what we need to do: 

  1. Find out if there's a reason you **shouldn't** seal your records.
  1. Ask questions about your old and open cases.
  1. Tell you if you might be eligible for sealing.
  1. Ask for personal details like your social security number.

  After that, we can give you a form (petition) to download,
  print, and sign. We'll tell you where to mail it.

  You need to know about your convictions in Massachusetts
  and in other states. You won't get in trouble for getting
  answers wrong, but it might be easier for you to give the
  right answers if you have a copy of your juvenile record report,
  and also your CORI report if you had cases in an adult court.
  These reports will give a summary of all your criminal charges
  in Massachusetts and tell you how each case ended.

  **Do you already have certified
  copies of docket sheets for all of your cases?**

  Note: A docket sheet is different than a
  criminal record report called a CORI or juvenile
  record report. Docket sheets are
  papers in your court case at the courthouse that say
  what happened in each of your cases every time
  you went to court.

  If you seal your
  records without getting the docket sheets
  for all of your cases first and
  ICE (Immigration  Customs Enforcement) requires a hearing,
  you might not have time to unseal those records
  and get the copies you need before the hearing. ICE staff
  get copies of FBI reports on people trying to become
  citizens or get papers to stay in the U.S., but the FBI
  reports often do not say if you were found guilty
  or what happened at the end of your case.
  **If you have a certified copy of the docket sheets for all
  of your cases, you can prove what really happened in your case.**

  It is a good idea to get a certified copy of the docket sheets for
  all of your cases before trying to seal your records.
  It may take some more time, but it may be better in the end.

question: About Docket Sheets
subquestion: |
  A docket sheet is different than a criminal record
  report (called a CORI) or juvenile record report. Docket
  sheets are papers from the courthouse that say
  what happened in a case every time you went
  to court for that case.

  If you seal your records you won't be able to get
  certified copies of your docket sheets until you
  unseal them again. That can sometimes take a long time.

  Sadly, every case has its own docket
  sheets and those sheets are kept at the courthouse
  that handled that case.
  
  ## Getting certified copies in person
  
  For each case, go to the clerk’s
  office in the courthouse that handled the case and say,
  "I'd like certified copies of my docket sheets
  for all of my cases." You have to do it
  at each courthouse where you had a case.

  It can cost up to $2.50 for each page, but if you
  can't affort to pay that much, you can ask,
  "Can I get the fee waived?" The staff will probably
  have you fill out a form called an
  “affidavit of indigency” where you'll put down
  how much you and the family members that live
  with you get payed. That's to show why you can't
  afford to pay the fee.

  ## Getting certified copies by mail
  
  You can also send a letter to ask for the docket
  sheets. If you want to order the sheets by mail, take
  these steps:
  
  1. Call the courthouse that handled the case
  and ask how much it will cost to print the sheets.
  1. Go to a post office to get a money order for that amount.
  1. Write a letter that asks for the docket
  sheets. This is an example of what it can look like:

  <br/>
  
  ${ today() }

  Clerk’s Office[BR]
  South Boston Division[BR]
  Boston Municipal Court[BR]
  535 East Broadway[BR]
  South Boston, MA 02127

  RE: Commonwealth v. John Doe[BR]
  Docket no. 0902CR12345[BR]
  Docket no. 1702CR98765432

  Dear Staff:

  Please send me certified copies of the docket sheets for my
  criminal cases that are listed above. 

  If you are not able to send me the certified copies
  or you have any questions, please call me at
  555-555-5555.

  Thank you for your help.

  Sincerely,

  (You sign the letter here)

  John Doe[BR]
  0 Jump St., Apt. # 2[BR]
  Boston, MA 02114
  
  <br/>
  
  4. Print that letter and sign it.
  1. Put the letter and the money order in an envelope.
  1. On the front of the envelope, write the courthouse's address.
  1. Above that address, write 'Attention: Criminal clerk's office'.
  1. Write your own mailing address in the top left of the envelope.
  1. Put a stamp on the envelope and mail it.

  If you don't get anything back (after how long??), call
  to find out how it's going.

  For certified copies

  go to the clerk’s office at the courthouse that

  but if your income is low, you can ask to get the fee waived.

  called an “affidavit of indigency” listing your
  income to get the fee waived.

  Once you mail it,
  the Commissioner of Probation
  will look at the petition you sent and at your criminal
  records. They'll see if they agree that you can seal
  your juvenile records.
  
  ## How will I know if my juvenile records are sealed?
  
  You'll get a letter from the Commissioner of Probation that
  says they've sealed your juvenile records. TODO: How long
  till it takes effect?
  
  Whatever they decide, they will send you a letter telling
  you what they decided to seal and why they made that decision.
  It can take up to 3 months to get a letter because so
  many people send them petitions to seal records.

  If you get the letter back and don't agree with what they
  said, you can call the Commissioner’s Office and ask
  them to explain to you why they would not seal all your
  records. The number is (617) 727 - 5300. You can also

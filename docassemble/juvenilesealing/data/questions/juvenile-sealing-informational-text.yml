  To find out, this is what we need to do: 

  1. Find out if there's a reason you **shouldn't** seal your records.
  1. Ask questions about your old and open cases.
  1. Tell you if you might be eligible for sealing.
  1. Ask for personal details like your social security number.

  After that, we can give you a form (petition) to download,
  print, and sign. We'll tell you where to mail it.

  It will help to know about your criminal records in Massachusetts
  and in other states. You won't get in trouble for getting
  answers wrong, but it might be easier for you to give the
  right answers if you have a copy of your juvenile record report,
  and also your CORI report if you had cases in an adult court.
  These reports will give a summary of all your criminal charges
  in Massachusetts and tell you how each case ended.

  **Do you already have certified
  copies of docket sheets for all of your cases?**

  Note: A docket sheet is different than a
  criminal record report called a CORI or juvenile
  record report. Docket sheets are
  papers in your court case at the courthouse that say
  what happened in each of your cases every time
  you went to court.
---
id: why_copies
template: why_copies_1
content: |
  If you seal your
  records without getting the docket sheets
  for all of your cases first and
  ICE (Immigration  Customs Enforcement) requires a hearing,
  you might not have time to unseal those records
  and get the copies you need before the hearing. ICE staff
  get copies of FBI reports on people trying to become
  citizens or get papers to stay in the U.S., but the FBI
  reports often do not say if you were found guilty
  or what happened at the end of your case.
  **If you have a certified copy of the docket sheets for all
  of your cases, you can prove what really happened in your case.**

  It is a good idea to get a certified copy of the docket sheets for
  all of your cases before trying to seal your records.
  It may take some more time, but it may be better in the end.

question: About Docket Sheets
subquestion: |
  ### What are docket sheets?

  ${docket_sheets_blurb} Docket
  sheets are papers from the courthouse that say
  what happened in a case every time you went
  to court for that case.
  
  ### What's different about a certified copy of the docket sheets?

  A certified copy of the sheets
  will have a special mark on it that looks like the
  courthouse's seal. It'll either be a colored stamp or
  an area where the paper is raised up in the shape of the
  seal.

  ### Why can sealing be a problem?

  If you seal your records you won't be able to get
  certified copies of your docket sheets until you
  unseal them again. That can sometimes take a long time.
  If you need to show your docket
  sheets to a judge at a hearing or you apply for some
  kinds of jobs, it might take too long to unseal your records
  and get those docket sheets.

  ## Getting certified copies

  Having
  {a copy of your Massachusetts criminal records}
  can make it easier to make sure you get all your docket
  sheets because they will have the docket numbers for
  your cases. Every case has its own docket
  sheets and those sheets are kept at the courthouse
  that handled that case.
  
  ### Getting certified copies in person
  
  Getting copies in person is the easiest and fastest
  way to do this. For each case, go to the clerk’s
  office in the courthouse that handled the case and say,
  "I'd like certified copies of my docket sheets
  for all of my cases." You have to do it
  at each courthouse where you had a case.

  It can cost up to $2.50 for each page, but if you
  can't afford to pay that much, you can ask,
  "Can I get the fee waived?" The staff will probably
  have you fill out a form called an
  “affidavit of indigency” where you'll put down
  how much you get paid. That's to show why you can't
  afford to pay the fee.

  ### Getting certified copies by mail
  
  Even though it's easier and faster to go in person,
  you can also send a letter to ask for the docket
  sheets. It can take two weeks or so. If you want
  to order the sheets by mail, take
  these steps:
  
  1. Call the courthouse that handled the case
  and ask how much you need to pay the court to
  print and mail the sheets.
  1. Go to a post office to get a money order for that amount.
  1. Write a letter that asks for the docket
  sheets. An example of what it can look like is at
  the bottom of this page.
  1. Print that letter and sign it.
  1. Put the letter and the money order in an envelope.
  1. On the front of the envelope, write the courthouse's address.
  1. Above that address, write *Attention: Criminal clerk's office*.
  1. Write your own mailing address in the top left of the envelope.
  1. Put a stamp on the envelope and mail it.

  If you don't get anything back after two or three weeks, call
  to find out how it's going.

  Once you mail it,
  the Commissioner of Probation
  will look at the petition you sent and at your criminal
  records. They'll see if they agree that you can seal
  your juvenile records.
  
  ## How will I know if my juvenile records are sealed?
  
  The Commissioner of Probation will send you a letter to
  tell you what they decide. The letter will say which records
  have been sealed. If some records aren't sealed, the letter
  will tell you why they made that decision. It can take up to
  3 months to get a letter because so many people send them
  petitions to seal records.
  
  If the letter says your records are sealed, it can still
  take about two weeks till your records are ready. Usually
  it's faster. After that, most employers won't see
  you have any record at all. Only employers that need federal
  background checks will be able to see a note that you have
  a sealed record. Other people, like police officers and judges,
  will also be able to see a note that you have a sealed record.

  If you get the letter back and don't agree with what they
  said, you can call the Commissioner’s Office and ask
  them to explain to you why they would not seal all your
  records. The number is (617) 727 - 5300. You can also

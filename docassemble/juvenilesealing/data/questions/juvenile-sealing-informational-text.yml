  To find out, this is what we need to do: 

  1. Find out if there's a reason you **shouldn't** seal your records.
  1. Ask questions about your old and open cases.
  1. Tell you if you might be eligible for sealing.
  1. Ask for personal details like your social security number.

  After that, we can give you a form (petition) to download,
  print, and sign. We'll tell you where to mail it.

  It might be easier to give the right answers if you
  have a copy of your juvenile record report,
  and also your CORI report if you had cases in an adult court.
  These reports will give a summary of all your criminal charges
  and tell you how each case ended.

  **Do you already have certified
  copies of docket sheets for all of your cases?**

  Note: A docket sheet is different than a
  criminal record report called a CORI or juvenile
  record report. Docket sheets are
  papers in your court case at the courthouse that say
  what happened in each of your cases every time
  you went to court.

  If you seal your
  records without getting the docket sheets
  for all of your cases first and
  ICE (Immigration  Customs Enforcement) requires a hearing,
  you might not have time to unseal those records
  and get the copies you need before the hearing. ICE staff
  get copies of FBI reports on people trying to become
  citizens or get papers to stay in the U.S., but the FBI
  reports often do not say if you were found guilty
  or what happened at the end of your case.
  **If you have a certified copy of the docket sheets for all
  of your cases, you can prove what really happened in your case.**

  It is a good idea to get a certified copy of the docket sheets for
  all of your cases before trying to seal your records.
  It may take some more time, but it may be better in the end.

question: About Docket Sheets
subquestion: |
  A docket sheet is different than a criminal record
  report (called a CORI) or juvenile record report. Docket
  sheets are papers from the courthouse that say
  what happened in a case every time you went
  to court for that case.

  If you seal your records you won't be able to get
  certified copies of your docket sheets until you
  unseal them again. That can sometimes take a long time.

  Sadly, every case has its own docket
  sheets and those sheets are kept at the courthouse
  that handled that case. For each case, go to the clerk’s
  office in the courthouse that handled the case and say,
  "I'd like certified copies of my docket sheets
  for all of my cases." You have to do it
  at each courthouse where you had a case.

  It can cost up to $2.50 for each page, but if you
  can't affort to pay that much, you can ask,
  "Can I get the fee waived?" The staff will probably
  have you fill out a form called an
  “affidavit of indigency” where you'll put down
  how much you and the family members that live
  with you get payed. That's to show why you can't
  afford to pay the fee.

  You can also send a letter to ask for the docket
  sheets.  If you want to order the sheets by mail,
  first call the courthouse and ask how much it will
  cost to print the sheets. Then write a letter that
  says, "What does it say?" Next write a check for
  the amount of money the courthouse wants. Put those
  both in an envelope to mail to the courthouse.
  Remember to include your return address on the envelope.
  If you don't get anything back, call to find out how
  it's going.

  If you seal your records,

  who can get CORI reports that have information about
  sealed records, so they might ask you some
  questions about those.

  You can always unseal your records to get the docket

  Once you mail it,
  the Commissioner of Probation
  will look at it and your criminal
  records. They'll see if they agree that you can seal
  your juvenile records. They will send you a letter
  telling you what they decided to seal
  and why they made that decision.

  It can take up to 3 months because so
  many people send them petitions to seal records.

  If you get the letter back and don't agree with what they
  said, you can call the Commissioner’s Office and ask
  them to explain to you why they would not seal all your
  records. The number is (617) 727 - 5300. You can also

  - Immigration asked in previous separate form.
  - Don't ask personal info until we know they want to print the form.
  - Personal info code can look like https://github.com/GBLS/docassemble-gbls/blob/master/docassemble/gbls/data/questions/basic-questions-gbls.yml

  - Do objects always need to be in their own file?
  - If I do `objects from file`, will that also pull
  in the logic below or do I have to import that separately?

  - Should `applicant` be `user` instead, even though the
  questions are about the applicant?

  - applicant: Individual

  We think you're probably eligible to seal your juvenile records.

  % if (needs_dockets):
  **You can also still see how to get a certified copy of the
  [docket sheets](${ url_action('about_docket_sheets') })
  for all of your cases**.
  It can take a while, but
  it is a good idea to get them before finishing your form.

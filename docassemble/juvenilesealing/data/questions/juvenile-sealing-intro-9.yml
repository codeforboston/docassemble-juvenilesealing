question: Can You Seal Your Massachusetts Juvenile Records?
subquestion: |

  Sealing your juvenile record means that most
  employers won't be able to see that it
  exists. Employers who do federal background checks and
  people like police and judges will see a note that you
  have a sealed criminal record.

  To see if you can try to seal your records, we will:

  1. Find out if there's a reason you **shouldn't** seal your records.
  1. Ask questions about your old and open cases.
  1. Tell you if we think you can seal your records.
  
  Then you can get your form right away or let us help
  you fill in the other parts too.
    
  ### Time
  
  It can take up to **40 minutes** to answer all the questions,
  though it's usually less.

  ### What you need

  You need to know about your old and open cases. That includes
  cases in other states and federal cases. Having
  {a copy of your criminal records}
  can help you know the answers to the questions.
  
  ### Privacy
  
  If we need to store anything about your identity
  we will ask you first.

  **Note:** Whenever we say USA
  that includes United States
  possessions (like Guam).

  Do you already have certified copies of the
  {docket sheets}

  **Note:** A docket sheet is different than a criminal
  record report (called a CORI) or juvenile record report.

subquestion: |
  There are times when it is important to have certified copies of
  your docket sheets for all your cases.

  If you're not a US citizen, it can be very important to have
  the copies for a hearing. It
  would be a good idea to talk to a lawyer before you seal
  your records.
  
  Certified copies of your docket sheets can also help for:

  * Getting jobs that need a federal background check
  * Applying for some government programs (like the Social Equity program)
  * Taking legal action because someone did something wrong in the case
  * Whenever you need to prove what happened in the case.

  Once you seal your records, you'll have to unseal them to get
  certified copies. That can sometimes take a while.

  Do you want to get certified copies of your docket sheets before
  filling out the form to seal your records?

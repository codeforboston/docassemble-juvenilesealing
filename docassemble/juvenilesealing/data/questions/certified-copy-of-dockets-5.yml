question: Can You Seal Your Juvenile Record?
subquestion: |

  Sealing your juvenile record means that most people
  and employers won't see anything at all about your
  juvenile record. There are rules about when you can
  and can't seal your juvenile records.

  To find out if you can, this is what we need to do: 

  1. Find out if there's a reason you **shouldn't** seal your records.
  1. Ask questions about your old and open cases.
  1. Tell you if you might be eligible for sealing.
  1. Ask for personal details like your social security number.

  After that, we can give you a form (petition) to download,
  print, and sign. We'll tell you where to mail it.

  ## More about this form
    
  ### How long does it take to finish?
  
  It can take about **40 minutes** to answer all the questions
  if you have the information you need.

  ### What kind of information do I need?

  ${records_can_help}

  ${getting_juvenile_records} ${getting_cori}

  You also might have to
  stop and come back later if you need to
  get a certified copy of your
  [docket sheets](${ url_action('about_docket_sheets') }).
  
  ### Privacy
  
  If we need to store any personally
  identifying information,
  like your name and social
  security number, we will ask you first.

  <br/>

  **Note:** Whenever we say USA
  that includes United States
  possessions (like Guam).

question: Have you talked to a lawyer?
subquestion: |
  If you seal your records and
  ICE (Immigration  Customs Enforcement) requires a hearing,
  it might take too long to get the paperwork
  they ask for. Getting
  [certified copies of the docket sheets for all of your cases](${ url_action('about_docket_sheets') })
  can help with that, but it's a good idea to
  get legal advice before sealing your records.
  
  Have you talked to a lawyer about what you

id: do_not_seal
event: do_not_seal
question: Sealing can be a bad idea for non-citizens
subquestion: |
  Please talk to a lawyer about what you should do.
  You can ask the lawyer about getting certified copies of the
  [docket sheets](${ url_action('about_docket_sheets') })
  for all of your cases before trying to seal your records.
  Getting those copies could take some more time,
  but it can be better in the end.
  You can look for legal help in your area by
  answering the questions on the
  [Mass Legal Help finder](https://www.masslegalservices.org/findlegalaid).

  If you seal your
  records without getting the
  [docket sheets](${ url_action('about_docket_sheets') })
  for all of your cases first and
  ICE (Immigration  Customs Enforcement) requires a hearing,
  you might not have time to unseal those records
  and get the copies you need before the hearing. ICE staff
  get copies of FBI reports on people trying to become
  citizens or get papers to stay in the U.S., but the FBI
  reports often do not say if you were found guilty
  or what happened at the end of your case.
  **If you have a certified copy of the
  [docket sheets](${ url_action('about_docket_sheets') })
  for all of your cases, you can prove
  what really happened in your case.**

  It is a good idea to get a certified copy of the
  [docket sheets](${ url_action('about_docket_sheets') })
  for all of your cases before trying to seal your records.
  It may take some more time, but it may be better in the end.

question: You may need your docket sheets to get some jobs
subquestion: |
  Some criminal charges may stop you from getting
  certain kinds of jobs,
  <span class="new">
  but some criminal charges aren't a problem.
  </span>
  If you seal your records,
  there are a few agencies and a few types of employers
  who can get CORI reports that have information about
  sealed records, so they might ask you some
  questions about those. They might want to look at
  the sheets to see if they can hire you.
  **If you have a certified copy of the
  [docket sheets](${ url_action('about_docket_sheets') })
  for all of your cases, you can prove what happened
  in your case.** This may help you get the job.

  You can always unseal your records to get the docket
  sheets, but it will take more time.
